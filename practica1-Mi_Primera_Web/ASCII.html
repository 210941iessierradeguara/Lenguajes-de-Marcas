                        On December 27th, 2012, Wikimedia user Daderot uploaded a photograph of a ceramic sculpture of a boar, describing it as "Boar Vessel, 600-500 BC, Estruscan, ceramic" from the Cleveland Museum of Art. <br>
                        <br>
                        On April 17th, 2013, the drawpaintprint Tumblr blog reposted the photo. On April 1st, 2015, Facebook page Edifying Etruscan Memes posted an image featuring a mock dialogue with a girl who reveals she only dates "Boar Vessel 600-500 BC Estruscan Ceramic" (shown below). On August 14th, 2016, the image was posted[4] to the subreddit /r/me_irl by Redditor OrdinaryHotdog. Prior to being archived, the post gained over 2,000 upvotes and 20 comments. <br>

                        On June 17th, 2018, the image was edited into the Etruscan art Wikipedia article. On June 17th, the /r/BoarVesselMeme subreddit was launched. On June 18th, Redditor LuxerHS submitted the boar vessel photo captioned with a variant of the I Bet There Will Be Flying Cars in the Future caption to /r/dankmemes (shown below, left). On the same day, a post asking "What's the deal with Boar Vessel" was submitted to /r/OutOfTheLoop. The following day, Redditor LuxerHS posted a "Guys Litterally Only Want One Thing" image using the boar vessel photo to /r/dankmeme <br>
